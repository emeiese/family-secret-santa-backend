This repository is for caculating the assignation problem for a FAMILY secret santa 🎅️

In this case, the complexity relies on the possible restrictions you may have. Some of them might be:
- you can't assign secret santas between direct family members (you want to encourage gifts between different families)
- you want to impose age restrictions (adults give to adulsts and children makes gifts for other children)

You might have another restrictions, so I encourage you to copy this repo and add them by yourself.
Hope this is useful. Have a happy christmas and good luck with your secret santa!
